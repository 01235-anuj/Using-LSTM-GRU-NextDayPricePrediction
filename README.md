# 📈 Next Day Stock Price Prediction using LSTM and GRU

This project compares **LSTM** and **GRU** deep learning models to predict the **next day's closing stock price of Barclays (BCS)** using historical data fetched via the `yfinance` API.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Accurately forecasting future stock prices is a challenging task due to the complex and volatile nature of financial markets. This project aims to evaluate and compare LSTM and GRU models for next-day stock price prediction.

## 📊 Data Source

- Historical stock data fetched from **Yahoo Finance** using the `yfinance` library.
- Ticker used: `BCS` (Barclays)

## 🧠 Models Used

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**

Both models are implemented using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on historical closing prices.


## 📈 Evaluation

The performance of both models was compared using:

- 📉 Loss Curves
- 📐 RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- 📊 Visual comparison of predicted vs actual prices
